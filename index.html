    <br>
    <p>My name is Prescott Rynewicz, and I was born and raised in San Jose California. I am currently a fourth year Aerospace Engineer and Computer Scientist at UCLA. I am passionate about everything Aerospace, as well as software engineering, physical computing, control systems, and general robotics.</p><br>
    <p>Outside of engineering and research, I am an actively engaged musician. I am the president of UCLA's only All Male A Cappella group, <a href= "http://www.BruinHarmony.com" target="_blank">Bruin Harmony</a>, and the founder of the UCLA A Cappella Council. I am also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. </p><br>

        <br>
        <p>I have been involved in music since a very young age, and have always been enamoured with music's ability
          to spread emotion and information without the barriers of language or experience.
          Here are a few excerpts from some of the projects I have participated in throughout my music career. </p>
